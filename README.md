# hello-worlds

Hello everyone, 

My name is Stanko Zovko and I am currently studying GIST at the University of Arizona. 
I have really enjoyed the journey so far and I look forward to diving deeper into the world of open source.
On a personal note, I enjoy playing music, planting trees and doing handy work.
